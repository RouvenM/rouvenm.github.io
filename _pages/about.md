Welcome to my personal website!

I am a statistician and postdoctoral researcher in the [Statistical Methods for Big Data group](https://bd.statistik.tu-dortmund.de/) at TU Dortmund University.

My research lies at the intersection of statistical modelling and machine learning, with a particular focus on hidden Markov models and tree-based methods.

I work primarily with event and tracking data from sports such as soccer, American football, and handball. My goal is to develop models that help evaluate players and teams, support strategic decision-making, and deepen our understanding of the dynamics of sports competitions.

Beyond sports analytics, I am also interested in applications in areas such as finance and energy markets.

## News

Together with my co-authors [Robert Bajons](https://rbstats.netlify.app/) and [Jan-Ole Fischer](https://janolefi.github.io/), we have recently published our pre-print 
*Integrating Unsupervised and Supervised Learning for the Prediction of Defensive Schemes in American Football* on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10784). 
Have a look and feel free to reach out in case of questions or comments!

Furthermore, I will present this work at the [16th Workshop on Stochastic Models, Statistics and Their Applications (SMSA)](https://www.smsa2026.de/), which will take place at the University of Würzburg from March 18 to March 20, 2026.

## Teaching

In the summer term 2026, I will give a lecture on *Hidden Markov and State Space Models*. 
If you are a Master’s student enrolled in Statistics, Data Science, or Econometrics at TU Dortmund University, you can join the course as an elective module. I look forward to welcoming you!
