I am a statistician and postdoctoral researcher in the [Statistical Methods for Big Data group](https://bd.statistik.tu-dortmund.de/) at TU Dortmund University.

My research lies at the intersection of statistical modelling and machine learning, specifically hidden Markov models (HMMs) and tree-based methods.

I work with data from various sports such as soccer, American football, and handball. My goal is to develop models that help evaluate players and teams and support strategic decision-making.

Beyond sports analytics, I am also interested in applications of HMMs to finance or energy data.

## News

Together with my co-authors [Robert Bajons](https://rbstats.netlify.app/) and [Jan-Ole Fischer](https://janolefi.github.io/), we have recently published our pre-print 
*Integrating Unsupervised and Supervised Learning for the Prediction of Defensive Schemes in American Football* on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10784). 
Have a look and feel free to reach out in case of questions or comments!

Furthermore, I will present this work at the [16th Workshop on Stochastic Models, Statistics and Their Applications (SMSA)](https://www.smsa2026.de/), which will take place at the University of Würzburg from March 18 to March 20, 2026.

## Teaching

In the summer term 2026, I will give a lecture on *Hidden Markov and State Space Models*. 
If you are a Master’s student enrolled in Statistics, Data Science, or Econometrics at TU Dortmund University, you can join the course as an elective module. I look forward to welcoming you!
