I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Faculty of Statistics](https://bd.statistik.tu-dortmund.de/) at TU Dortmund University.

My research lies at the intersection of statistical modelling and machine learning, specifically hidden Markov models (HMMs) and tree-based methods.

Working with data from various sports (such as soccer, American football, and handball), my goal is to develop models that help evaluate players and teams and support strategic decision-making.

Beyond sports analytics, I am also interested in applications of HMMs to finance or energy data.

## News

Together with my co-authors [Robert](https://rbstats.netlify.app/) and [Ole](https://janolefi.github.io/), we have published our pre-print 
*Integrating Unsupervised and Supervised Learning for the Prediction of Defensive Schemes in American Football* on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10784). 
Feel free to reach out in case of questions or comments!

Furthermore, I will present this work at the [16th Workshop on Stochastic Models, Statistics and Their Applications (SMSA)](https://www.smsa2026.de/), taking place in Würzburg in this March.

## Teaching

In the summer term 2026, I will give a lecture on *Hidden Markov and State Space Models*. 
If you are a Master’s student enrolled in Statistics, Data Science, or Econometrics at TU Dortmund University, you can join the course as an elective module. I look forward to welcoming you!
